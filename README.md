# spicetify-dribblish-script-install
This script will automatically install [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) and then installs the [Dribblish Dynamic](https://github.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme) theme, afterwards it will install [extensions](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Extensions).


## How the script works

The home page of said script here found here: https://github.com/JulienMaille/dribbblish-dynamic-theme#install--update

### Instation of Extensions
The extensions this script will install are: [FullAppDisplay](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Extensions#full-app-display), [Reddit](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Custom-Apps#reddit), and [Lyrics Plus](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Custom-Apps#lyrics-plus).

The **Reddit** app fetches posts from any Spotify link sharing subreddit and puts them in a simple and easy to use method of browsing.
